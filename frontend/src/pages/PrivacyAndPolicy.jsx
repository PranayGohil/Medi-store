                The Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative
                procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal
                information, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all
                financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption
                to protect your personal information online, and we also take
                several steps to protect your personal information in our
                facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted.
                Only employees who need access to your personal information to
                perform a specific job are granted access to your personal
                information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers
                for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We
                believe that their security procedures are adequate. For
                example, when you visit the Site, you access servers that are
                kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and
                an electronic firewall. While we use industry-standard
                precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot
                guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not
                presently exist anywhere online or offline. OPT OUT/CORRECTIONS
                Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal
                information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address;
                and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases

                As you might expect from us, the majority of information that we
                collect is obtained through the Site, and this Privacy Policy
                applies only to that online collection of personal information.
                We also may collect information offline, where we also try to
                protect the privacy of your personal information. One example
                involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask
                questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal
                information we need in order to place the order or to answer the
                question. When we need to store information (such as order
                information), we will enter it into our database through SSL
                encryption. (See the Data Security section above for more
                information). Another example involves faxes. If you fax
                something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store
                it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no
                need to retain the information. There are other ways we could
                learn of personal information offline (for example, we suppose
                someone could send us a letter including some return address
                information), and this Policy doesn't discuss or try to predict
                all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we will try to
                treat offline collection, uses, and disclosures consistently
                with our relevant online practices. UPDATES TO THIS POLICY If we
                change or update this Privacy Policy, we will post changes and
                updates on the Site so that you will always be aware of what
                information we collect, use and disclose. We encourage you to
                review this Privacy Policy from time to time so you will know if
                the Privacy Policy has been changed or updated. If you have any
                questions about the Privacy Policy, please contact us
